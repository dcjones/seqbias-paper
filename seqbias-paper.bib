@article{Lee2010,
abstract = {We propose a novel, efficient and intuitive approach of estimating mRNA abundances from the whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Our method, NEUMA (Normalization by Expected Uniquely Mappable Area), is based on effective length normalization using uniquely mappable areas of gene and mRNA isoform models. Using the known transcriptome sequence model such as RefSeq, NEUMA pre-computes the numbers of all possible gene-wise and isoform-wise informative reads: the former being sequences mapped to all mRNA isoforms of a single gene exclusively and the latter uniquely mapped to a single mRNA isoform. The results are used to estimate the effective length of genes and transcripts, taking experimental distributions of fragment size into consideration. Quantitative RT-PCR based on 27 randomly selected genes in two human cell lines and computer simulation experiments demonstrated superior accuracy of NEUMA over other recently developed methods. NEUMA covers a large proportion of genes and mRNA isoforms and offers a measure of consistency ('consistency coefficient') for each gene between an independently measured gene-wise level and the sum of the isoform levels. NEUMA is applicable to both paired-end and single-end RNA-Seq data. We propose that NEUMA could make a standard method in quantifying gene transcript levels from RNA-Seq data.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that MyoD initiates a feed-forward regulation of skeletal muscle gene expression, predicting that MyoD binds directly to many genes expressed during differentiation. We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing to identify genome-wide binding of MyoD in several skeletal muscle cell types. As anticipated, MyoD preferentially binds to a VCASCTG sequence that resembles the in vitro-selected site for a MyoD:E-protein heterodimer, and MyoD binding increases during differentiation at many of the regulatory regions of genes expressed in skeletal muscle. Unanticipated findings were that MyoD was constitutively bound to thousands of additional sites in both myoblasts and myotubes, and that the genome-wide binding of MyoD was associated with regional histone acetylation. Therefore, in addition to regulating muscle gene expression, MyoD binds genome wide and has the ability to broadly alter the epigenome in myoblasts and myotubes.},

@article{Dohm2008,
abstract = {Novel sequencing technologies permit the rapid production of large sequence data sets. These technologies are likely to revolutionize genetics and biomedical research, but a thorough characterization of the ultra-short read output is necessary. We generated and analyzed two Illumina 1G ultra-short read data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer reads from a Beta vulgaris genomic clone and 12.3 million 36mers from the Helicobacter acinonychis genome. We found that error rates range from 0.3\% at the beginning of reads to 3.8\% at the end of reads. Wrong base calls are frequently preceded by base G. Base substitution error frequencies vary by 10- to 11-fold, with A > C transversion being among the most frequent and C > G transversions among the least frequent substitution errors. Insertions and deletions of single bases occur at very low rates. When simulating re-sequencing we found a 20-fold sequencing coverage to be sufficient to compensate errors by correct reads. The read coverage of the sequenced regions is biased; the highest read density was found in intervals with elevated GC content. High Solexa quality scores are over-optimistic and low scores underestimate the data quality. Our results show different types of biases and ways to detect them. Such biases have implications on the use and interpretation of Solexa data, for de novo sequencing, re-sequencing, the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and DNA methylation sites, as well as for transcriptome analysis.},

@article{Ben-Gal2005,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: We propose a new class of variable-order Bayesian network (VOBN) models for the identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). The proposed models generalize the widely used position weight matrix (PWM) models, Markov models and Bayesian network models. In contrast to these models, where for each position a fixed subset of the remaining positions is used to model dependencies, in VOBN models, these subsets may vary based on the specific nucleotides observed, which are called the context. This flexibility turns out to be of advantage for the classification and analysis of TFBSs, as statistical dependencies between nucleotides in different TFBS positions (not necessarily adjacent) may be taken into account efficiently--in a position-specific and context-specific manner. RESULTS: We apply the VOBN model to a set of 238 experimentally verified sigma-70 binding sites in Escherichia coli. We find that the VOBN model can distinguish these 238 sites from a set of 472 intergenic 'non-promoter' sequences with a higher accuracy than fixed-order Markov models or Bayesian trees. We use a replicated stratified-holdout experiment having a fixed true-negative rate of 99.9\%. We find that for a foreground inhomogeneous VOBN model of order 1 and a background homogeneous variable-order Markov (VOM) model of order 5, the obtained mean true-positive (TP) rate is 47.56\%. In comparison, the best TP rate for the conventional models is 44.39\%, obtained from a foreground PWM model and a background 2nd-order Markov model. As the standard deviation of the estimated TP rate is approximately 0.01\%, this improvement is highly significant.},

In the present paper, prediction will be focused on various grades of cervical preneoplasia and neoplasia. Statistical tools used for prediction should of course possess predictive accuracy, and preferably meet secondary requirements such as speed, ease of use, and interpretability of the resulting predictive model. A new automated procedure based on an extension (called 'boosting') of regression and classification tree (CART) models is described. The resulting tool is a fast 'off-the-shelf' procedure for classification and regression that is competitive in accuracy with more customized approaches, while being fairly automatic to use (little tuning), and highly robust especially when applied to less than clean data. Additional tools are presented for interpreting and visualizing the results of such multiple additive regression tree (MART) models.},

Several of the offered services are computationally demanding, such as genome-wide predictions of DNA binding sites in mammalian genomes or sets of 10(4)-fold cross-validation experiments for different model combinations based on problem-specific data sets.

@article{Gao2011,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technology is being rapidly applied to quantifying transcripts (RNA-seq). However, due to the unique properties of the RNA-seq data, the differential expression of longer transcripts is more likely to be identified than that of shorter transcripts with the same effect size. This bias complicates the downstream gene set analysis (GSA) because the methods for GSA previously developed for microarray data are based on the assumption that genes with same effect size have equal probability (power) to be identified as significantly differentially expressed. Since transcript length is not related to gene expression, adjusting for such length dependency in GSA becomes necessary. RESULTS: In this paper, we proposed two approaches for transcript-length adjustment for analyses based on Poisson models: 1) At individual gene level, we adjusted each gene's test statistic using the square root of transcript length followed by testing for gene set using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test. 2) At gene-set level, we adjusted the null distribution for the Fisher's exact test by weighting the identification probability of each gene using the square root of its transcript length. We evaluated these two approaches using simulations and a real dataset, and showed that these methods can effectively reduce the transcript-length biases. The top ranked GO terms obtained from the proposed adjustments show more overlaps with the microarray results.

@article{Chen2005,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Owing to the complete sequencing of human and many other genomes, huge amounts of DNA sequence data have been accumulated. In bioinformatics, an important issue is how to predict the complete structure of genes from the genomic DNA sequence, especially the human genome. A crucial part in the gene structure prediction is to determine the precise exon-intron boundaries, i.e. the splice sites, in the coding region. RESULTS: We have developed a dependency graph model to fully capture the intrinsic interdependency between base positions in a splice site. The establishment of dependency between two position is based on a chi2-test from known sample data. To facilitate statistical inference, we have expanded the dependency graph (which is usually a graph with cycles that make probabilistic reasoning very difficult, if not impossible) into a Bayesian network (which is a directed acyclic graph that facilitates statistical reasoning). When compared with the existing models such as weight matrix model, weight array model, maximal dependence decomposition, Cai et al.'s tree model as well as the less-studied second-order and third-order Markov chain models, the expanded Bayesian networks from our dependency graph models perform the best in nearly all the cases studied.

@article{Srivastava2010,
abstract = {Deep sequencing of RNAs (RNA-seq) has been a useful tool to characterize and quantify transcriptomes. However, there are significant challenges in the analysis of RNA-seq data, such as how to separate signals from sequencing bias and how to perform reasonable normalization. Here, we focus on a fundamental question in RNA-seq analysis: the distribution of the position-level read counts. Specifically, we propose a two-parameter generalized Poisson (GP) model to the position-level read counts. We show that the GP model fits the data much better than the traditional Poisson model. Based on the GP model, we can better estimate gene or exon expression, perform a more reasonable normalization across different samples, and improve the identification of differentially expressed genes and the identification of differentially spliced exons. The usefulness of the GP model is demonstrated by applications to multiple RNA-seq data sets.},

@article{Pudimat2005,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The identification of transcription factor binding sites in promoter sequences is an important problem, since it reveals information about the transcriptional regulation of genes. For analysing transcriptional regulation, computational approaches for predicting putative binding sites are applied. Commonly used stochastic models for binding sites are position-specific score matrices, which show weak predictive power. RESULTS: We have developed a probabilistic modelling approach, which allows to consider diverse characteristic binding site properties to obtain more accurate representations of binding sites. These properties are modelled as random variables in Bayesian networks, which are capable of dealing with dependencies among binding site properties. Cross-validation on several datasets shows improvements in the false positive error rate and the significance (P-value) of true binding sites.},
